# JFormalize

Loads, parses and validates a JSON file into formalized ruby objects according to a schema.

According to the dictionary, to formalize is to:

1. To make agree with a single established standard or model
2. To give official acceptance of as satisfactory
3. To make solemn, or official, through ceremony or legal act
4. To represent in a particular style

While it is humorous to think of JSON involving solemnity, officialness or legality, 
it certainly involves ceremony.

This gem provides a simple way to validate a file, load it as JSON, parse it and formalize objects into ruby objects.

This involves a process like this:

- PreLoad
- Load
- Objectify
- Formalize

## `PreLoad`

This involves verifying that a provide file pass the following tests:

1. It must exist
2. It must be a file (e.g. not a directory)
3. It must be readable
4. It must not be too big
5. 

The first 3 are self explanatory.
Number 4 and 5 require some explanation.

A file has a size and the gem tests that this size does not exceed a limit.
The allowed maximum size either defaults to 1,000,000 characters or a value provided to the pre-loader.
